# Amazon Simple Notification Service 
- Managed service that provides message delivery from publishers to subscribers (also known as producers and consumers).
- Publishers communicate asynchronously with subscribers by sending messages to a topic.
- Clients can subscribe to the SNS topic and receive published messages using a supported endpoint type.
-  SNS follows the “publish-subscribe” (pub-sub) messaging paradigm, with notifications being delivered to clients using a
   “push” mechanism rather than to periodically check or “poll” for new information and updates.
