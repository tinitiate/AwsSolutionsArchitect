# Amazon Simple Queue Service (SQS)
- Amazon SQS offers a secure, durable, and available hosted queue that lets you integrate and decouple distributed software systems and components.
- Amazon SQS offers common constructs such as dead-letter queues and cost allocation tags. 
- Provides a generic web services API that you can access using any programming language that the AWS SDK supports.
- Amazon SQS supports:
  - Standard  
  - FIFO queues

| Standard queue                                               | FIFO queue                                                   |
| :----------------------------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Unlimited Throughput** – Standard queues support a nearly unlimited number of API calls per second, per API action (`SendMessage`, `ReceiveMessage`, or `DeleteMessage`).**At-Least-Once Delivery** – A message is delivered at least once, but occasionally more than one copy of a message is delivered. **Best-Effort Ordering** – Occasionally, messages are delivered in an order different from which they were sent. | **High Throughput** – If you use batching, FIFO queues support up to 3,000 messages per second, per API method (`SendMessageBatch`, `ReceiveMessage`, or `DeleteMessageBatch`). The 3000 messages per second represent 300 API calls, each with a batch of 10 messages. To request a quota increase, submit a support request. Without batching, FIFO queues support up to 300 API calls per second, per API method (`SendMessage`, `ReceiveMessage`, or `DeleteMessage`).**Exactly-Once Processing** – A message is delivered once and remains available until a consumer processes and deletes it. Duplicates aren't introduced into the queue. **First-In-First-Out Delivery** – The order in which messages are sent and received is strictly preserved. |

| Send data between applications when the throughput is important, for example: Decouple live user requests from intensive background work: let users upload media while resizing or encoding it. Allocate tasks to multiple worker nodes: process a high number of credit card validation requests. Batch messages for future processing: schedule multiple entries to be added to a database. | Send data between applications when the order of events is important, for example: Make sure that user-entered commands are run in the right order. Display the correct product price by sending price modifications in the right order. Prevent a student from enrolling in a course before registering for an account. |
