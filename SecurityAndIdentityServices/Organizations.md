# AWS Organizations
- AWS Organizations is an account management service that enables you to consolidate multiple AWS accounts into an organization 
  that you create and centrally manage. 
- AWS Organizations includes account management and consolidated billing capabilities.
- We can create groups of accounts and then apply policies to those groups.
- Organizations provides you a policy framework for multiple AWS accounts. 
- AWS Organizations, like many other AWS services, is eventually consistent. 
- It achieves high availability by replicating data across multiple servers in AWS data centers within its region.

## Administrative Actions in Organizations
- Create an AWS account and add it to your organization, or add an existing AWS account to your organization.
- Organize your AWS accounts into groups called organizational units (OUs).
- Organize your OUs into a hierarchy that reflects your companyâ€™s structure.
- Centrally manage and attach policies to the entire organization, OUs, or individual AWS accounts.
