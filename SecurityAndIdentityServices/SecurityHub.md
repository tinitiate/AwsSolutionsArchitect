# AWS Security Hub
- AWS Security Hub provides you with a comprehensive view of your security state in AWS 
- Helps you check your environment against security industry standards and best practices.
- Security Hub collects security data from across AWS accounts, services, and 
  supported third-party partner products and helps you analyze your security trends and identify the highest priority security issues.
- When you enable Security Hub, it begins to consume, aggregate, organize, and prioritize findings from AWS services that you have enabled, 
  such as Amazon GuardDuty, Amazon Inspector, and Amazon Macie.
- Security Hub also generates its own findings by running continuous, automated security checks based on AWS best practices and supported industry standards. 
- Security Hub then correlates and consolidates findings across providers to help you to prioritize the most significant findings. 
- Security Hub works with AWS Organizations to simplify security posture management across all of your existing and future AWS accounts in an organization.
- Integrated dashboards consolidate your security findings across accounts to show you their current security and compliance status.
- You can send security findings to ticketing, chat, email, or automated remediation systems through integration with Amazon CloudWatch Events.
- All findings are stored for at least 90 days within AWS Security Hub.
